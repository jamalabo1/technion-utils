## PDF Utils

So mostly when I print things, they are useually poorlly spaced (margins, etc...) so Instead of manually adjusting the scale for printing (& manually for pages when asymmetric) I created
this script which with scale based on content (thresholds & adds margin) so it's easy to read when printing 

the usage is intutive for the gui & cli.
